### Abstract
We are proposing to build a Web portal called Malware Classifier with a potential capability to solve the classification problem in the malware industry .This portal helps the System Administrators to identify the malware in a group so that the remedies can be directly applied to a whole group solving the issue in a short time. The Malware classifier also has the potential to save the malware files in
the local database or in the Admins database which can be further used to train the machine learning classifier improving the accuracy of the algorithm. Nearly eleven thousand files with extension “bytes” that has an average size of 4.2 MB were used to train the algorithm. Each byte file consists of Hexadecimal code from which 256 features are extracted to train the machine learning model. Prediction of the Malware classifier will be based on the entropy value of the Tree generated from the Xgboost algorithm.
